# Opacity Wizard

This tool was developed to allow for easy and fast visualizations of opacity and abundance data 
for exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres. In particular it was designed to be used by observers
studying those substellar objects as an easy way of exploring which molecules are most important
for a given planet and predict where the absorption features of those molecules will be. It is 
simple to use for non-python experts and requires only a python installation, numpy and matplotlib, 
and IPython 2. Instructions for installing IPython 2 can be found [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html). 
_ NOTE: IPython had a major recent upgrade to IPython 3 (Jupyter). It is NOT backwards compatible with IPython 2 notebooks. In particular, all of the Widgets have changed names and syntaxes. At some point I'd like to release an IPython 3 version, but right now one is not available. I believe the only option is to deprecate your version of IPython. _ 

A preview of the notebook (without the interactive widgets!) can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/astrocaroline/opacity-wizard/blob/master/Opacity%20Wizard.ipynb). 

After installing IPython 2 and cloning this repository (_from a terminal, type "git clone https://www.github.com/astrocaroline/opacity-wizard" or just download using the "Download ZIP" button in the corner of this page_), run the notebook from a terminal 
window in the cloned directory by typing

_ipython notebook_

at the command line, which will open a browser. Click on the notebook (Opacity Wizard.ipynb) to 
run and follow the instructions in the notebook. Just like Mathematica, you type "shift enter" to 
execute the three cells containing code. 

Instructions for acknowledgments/citations are found at the bottom of the notebook.

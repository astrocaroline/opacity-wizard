# opacity-wizard

This tool was developed to allow for easy and fast visualizations of opacity and abundance data 
for exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres. In particular it was designed to be used by observers
studying those substellar objects as an easy way of exploring which molecules are most important
for a given planet and predict where the absorption features of those molecules will be. It is 
simple to use for non-python experts and requires only a python installation, numpy and matplotlib, 
and IPython 2. Instructions for installing IPython 2 can be found [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html). 

A preview of the notebook (sans widgets!) can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/astrocaroline/opacity-wizard/blob/master/Opacity%20Wizard.ipynb). 

After installing IPython 2 and cloning this repository, run the notebook by typing

_ipython notebook_

at the command line, which will open a browser. Click on the notebook (Opacity Wizard.ipynb) to 
run and follow the instructions in the notebook. Just like Mathematica, you type "shift enter" to 
execute the three cells containing code. 

Instructions for acknowledgments/citations are found at the bottom of the notebook. 

Enjoy!
